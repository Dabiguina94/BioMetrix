# BioMetrix

The goal of `BioMetrix` is to …

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `BioMetrix` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("BioMetrix")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library("BioMetrix")
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
set.seed(0)
matrix <- round(matrix(runif(30, min = 0, max = 100), nrow = 10, ncol = 3), 2)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

    #> No id variables; using all as measure variables

<img src="man/figures/README-matrix-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub!
